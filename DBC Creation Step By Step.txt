Overall
=======================
This version is compatible with the HD WOD model patches out there
No idea how the HD patches are done so I just overwrote some files from the regular version with some files from Worgoblin repo (after modifying them) https://github.com/araxiaonline/mod-worgoblin/tree/araxia-main/data/patch-hd/DBFilesClient
See worgoblin in this file to see which 4 files were modified


Step by step to create the DBC files manually
=======================
Open file in WDBX Editor
Export to SQL. That's the original DBC table. Keep in handy in case you need to reset the table. 
run sudo mysql dbc < File.sql to (re)create the table in the "dbc" DB or any dev db you want
Make your edits in mysql (with the specific instructions below, and the companion SQL file with commands)
Export the table to CSV file
Import it in WDBX Editor, replacing all data
Save the file


After editing all DBFilesClient files:
=======================
Put them in the server (build/data/dbc folder)
Use MPQ Editor, create a new MPQ file with the contents of the DBFilesClient folder. 
Place it in the data dir of WoW client
Run the server SQL commands (some server tables aren't in DBC files)
Restart the server



After editing all client only files
=======================
Put them in an mpq in the client. The exact order depends on what other shit you have installed so it's case by case.

Patch-5.dbc: client only file:
This file contains all helmets copied and renamed from _Be to _He . Without it, helmets do not display.
This file also contains the new character Interface modifications. Alternatively, those could just be pasted into Interface folder, but better pack it to keep each release intact.
Known issue: for High elf, female hair go over some helmets (DK starting helmet for example).
Patch-a.dbc: contains all DBC files also in the server
Patch-t.dbc: goes after the HD models patch to rewrite some textures the HD models overwrite. It contains some of the DBC files from patch-a. Added this because the HD patch screws up some textures, likely rewriting things in Patch-a. So patch-t rewrites them again, but not all DBCs were needed.
Steps done to create helmets in Patch-5:
Extracted all helmets with MPQ extractor, starting from the highest expansion mpq file to the lowest, not overriding.
	Alternative: start from the lowest mpq file to the highest, overriding as they are extracted. This is so only the latest helmet models remain
Run a shell script to mass rename from _Be to _He
Throw into a new mpq at the correct folder: Item\ObjectComponents\Head
